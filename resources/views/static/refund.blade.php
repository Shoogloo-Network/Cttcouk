                        <p>Thank you for choosing our services for your travel needs. We understand that plans may
                            change, and we strive to accommodate your requests to the best of our ability. Please be
                            informed about our cancellation and refund policy detailed
                            below:<br /><br /><strong>Third-Party Booking and Cancellation:</strong> We utilize
                            third-party rail providers for bookings, cancellations, and refunds. Therefore, all booking,
                            cancellation, and refund processes are subject to the terms and conditions set forth by the
                            respective rail provider.<br /><br /><strong>Refund and Cancellation
                                Process:</strong><br /><br />The refund turnaround time for cancellations and refunds,
                            as stated by the rail provider, is typically within 5-7 days after the cancellation is
                            confirmed by them. This means that once you cancel your booking and the rail provider
                            acknowledges the cancellation, they will initiate the refund process, and you should expect
                            to receive the refunded amount within the specified timeframe.</p>
